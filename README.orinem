This fork has been merged with upstream: https://github.com/bsdphk/PyReveng3

It remains to retain the mostly uninformative git history that was abandoned when the HP 3455A example was added to https://github.com/bsdphk/PyReveng3.

Orin's changes:

Fix for python 3.X - use // instead of / for integer division where integer result is (eventually) required.
